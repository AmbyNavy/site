# About the Functional Rules
This document, known as the Functional Rules, is all of the core engine components that make up this game. 
It does not include any actual mechanical components to utilise as a player or Director - it is a manual that you can build your game on top of.
This game is generally modular, in that you can take most elements out as a whole, put your own version in, and the game still functions.
Some parts are tied together and may need taken out as a larger chunk if you wish to remove them.
This game assumes a magical, fantasy setting is being used however it can be easily modified to be used in other settings.
## About this version
This version of this game is ***HIGHLY VOLATILE!*** It is unlikely that any of this is close to final and should not be treated as such. Only the diamonds in the rough will last, and even then, they’re going to need some refinement ;)
## The Overarching Tenets
*The following overarching tenets apply to all of this game. Refer back to here first if you ever feel like information or context is missing.*
0. **Adapt the Functional Rules to your needs.** It’s recommended to experience this game as provided so you understand what makes it tick, but once you do, change the numbers of what you dont like. Drop in your own health system. Remove the half-level bonus if you don’t like it. Whatever you do with the Functional Rules, make sure it fosters the most fun at your table and fits the goal of the fantasy you want to experience and the story you want to tell with your playgroup. **This rule is the only one you cannot change.**
1. This game is designed to be modified by features, items, tags and traits. As such, if any other game element, such as a feature, contradicts the Functional Rules, treat the contradicting element as the correct ruling for that situation. 
	- *Example:* A feature says this character heals injuries based on their Vibe. This contradicts the rules in [[#Healing]]. Use the ruling in the feature for this character, not the rule in the core. 
		- This is an obvious example, but this rule holds empirically true - the Functional Rules are designed to be overwritten by the rest of the game.
2. This game uses rounding quite a bit. When you round, round down unless explicitly stated otherwise.
3. This game will often need you to have the value of half your level on hand. This is referred to throughout the game as HL.
	- Some characters may be level 0 - it is correct that dividing by 0 is a complex math problem. In this case, ignore math and treat HL as 0.
# Characters 
A character is a living being.
Characters are either controlled by players, usually known as Player Characters, or by the Director, usually known as Non-Player Characters or NPCs.
NPCs are built differently to Player Characters, but share some details - their exceptions are noted throughout. 
During character creation, you are technically level 0 up until you pick an archetype. 
When you select an archetype, your character counts as level 1.
You could roleplay the process of getting an archetype and reaching level 1 if you want, but most treat it as backstory. 
	- **Note to self - write a process for roleplaying this out. idea of a three beat intro story that each time you conclude a beat you get the attribute score most relevant to that beat. This way players could discover their attributes via play if they wanted!** 
## Ancestry
Your ancestry is what kind of creature you are.
It is made up of two lineages - the dominant lineage of your parents’ ancestries.
Each lineage has a variety of sub-lineages - different kinds of the same overarching lineage.
Once your ancestry is made, you will have four lineage features from two lineages, and you will know the sub-lineage of each lineage.
### Building your Ancestry
When you build your ancestry, you select two lineages. Pick one of these to be dominant, and one to be recessive.
- You can pick the same lineage twice.
- If you’re thinking about the lineages of your character’s parents, pick what would have been their dominant lineages.
When you select a lineage as dominant, you gain its dominant features.
For each lineage, select one sub-lineage - you gain that sub-lineage as a trait.
- If you have picked the same lineage twice, you can select the same or a different sub-lineage.
Take two variable lineage features from those available to each lineage.
- You can only take variable lineage features that either have no sub-lineage trait or a trait matching your sub-lineage.
When writing the name of your ancestry on your character sheet, write it as `Dominant Sub-lineage / Recessive Sub-lineage`.
- The name of the sub-lineage overwrites the name of the lineage for the sake of specificity.
#### Establishing Size and Age
Every lineage has a minimum size, a maximum size and a maximum age. 
These should be averaged out to find how long your character can live and what size they can be.
To do so, pair each value up with the matching value of the other lineage, add them together, and then divide the result by two. 
## Attributes
Attributes are numbers that represent a characters innate capabilities in different categories.
There are two types of attributes, Core and Archetype.
### Core Attributes
Everyone has six core attributes. All of them start at 0.
- **Brawn** - feats of might, power of physical form.
- **Finesse** - agility, exactness of action, physical flexibility.
- **Mettle** - ability to endure physical/mental strain.
- **Acumen** - sharp, quick thought processing - intuiting answers quickly.
- **Logic** - broad, deep thought processing - thinking complex problems through.
- **Vibe** - conveyance and reception of emotion/intent.
Brawn and Finesse are considered Physical attributes.
Acumen, Logic and Vibe are considered Mental attributes.
Mettle can be considered as Physical or Mental depending on the situation. 
- Generally, it sits alongside Physical attributes.
Every four levels (4, 8, 12…), you increase two core attributes of your choice by one.
Magical sources may boost these scores temporarily or permanently.
#### Selecting Core Attributes
At level 1, you put a 2 into one attribute and a 1 into two others. 
- *Example:* An example attribute set might be: **Brawn** 2 | **Finesse** 0 | **Mettle** 1 | **Acumen** 0 | **Logic** 0 | **Vibe** 1
- *Extra Rule:* you may add either an extra 2 or an extra 1 into a attribute of your choice, however you must put a -2 or a -1 into another attribute respectively.
	- *Clarity:* These are not additive - you cannot combine multiple onto one attribute. Each attribute should have a single number in it at the start.
	- *Example:* An example attribute set with this rule might be **Brawn** -2 | **Finesse** 2 | **Mettle** 1 | **Acumen** 1 | **Logic** 0 | **Vibe** 2
Attributes have a base maximum of 5. 
- This maximum cannot be exceeded even by magical means - you are not strong enough to wield that much power!
- This maximum increases by 5 at level 11 and every 10 levels thereafter. 
### Archetype Attributes
Each [[#Archetypes|Archetype]] has a unique seventh attribute.
- ***Warrior:*** Presence
	- Presence is a mix of a Warrior’s force of will, personality and physicality as well as technical prowess.
- ***Devout:*** Bind
	- Bind is the strength of a Devout’s connection to their source of power.
- ***Adept:*** Flow
	- Flow is a representation of an Adept’s fluidity of (and between) thought and action.
- ***Mage:*** Aether
	- Aether is the general name of magic.
At level 1, your archetype attribute starts at 3.
Your archetype attribute increases by 1 every three levels after (4, 7, 10…).
There is no cap for your archetype attribute.
## Archetypes
As an adventurer, you will select one of four archetypes.
These signify broad umbrellas for distinct playstyles that have counterplay against each other.
The four archetypes are Warrior, Devout, Adept and Mage.
- **Warrior**: Explicitly non-magical fighters. *(Barbarians, Martial Artists, Rangers)*
	- **Warriors** have either eschewed magic or simply are incapable of using it.
	- Capable of repelling and deflecting magic from others, and cutting off the magic of **Devout** characters.
	- An effective **Warrior** is one who is present on the battlefield and cannot be ignored.
- **Devout**: Characters who gain their magic from external sources. *(Clerics, Acolytes, Oracles, Druids)*
	- These individuals can have their connection to their magic cut off.
		- However, their magic is incredibly hard to suppress due to the source not actually being the **Devout** themselves.
	- An effective **Devout** is one who has a deep, strong connection to the patron of their power.
- **Adept**: Versatile warrior-charmers. *(Rogues, Troubadours, Artificers, Investigators)*
	- Typically faces of a party, but also negotiators and tricksy inventors.
		- Half-magical characters who also bear weaponry fall under **Adept** too. *(Monks, Swashbucklers, Spellswords)*
	- **Adept** characters are capable of supressing the magic of **Mage** characters
	- An effective **Adept** is one who flows through their actions with little interruption.
- **Mage**: Characters who source and manifest their magic from themselves. *(Psions, Wizards, Blood Magicians)*
	- The magic these characters cast can be *suppressed* by other characters.
		- However, that suppression isn’t complete, and a **Mage** cannot be disconnected from their power.
	- These characters typically have very little in terms of physical weaponry.
	- An effective **Mage** is one who has connected with and studied the world’s magic to a great extent. 
Many features and items in this game will be tagged with one or more archetypes. 
You can only select options for and make effective use of anything which specifies your archetype.
- *Clarity:* If something does not mention any archetypes, consider it usable by anyone.
## Items
Items are physical objects that you find and carry with you on your adventure. 
They take up [[#Carrying|slots in your inventory]] and come in a wide variety of kinds.
All items have a name, a series of traits, the amount of slots it takes up and a detailed description of what it is and does.
Some items may have [[#Features]] that are baked into their descriptions.
### Weapons
Weapons are what you hurt people with - clubs, bows, swords, wands or 
### Armour
Armour is protective gear that by default is protection from the neck down.
- Helmets are still armour, however are counted separately from body protection.
Wearing armour takes up inventory slots - usually two or four.
- Helmets normally take up one to two slots.
Armour always comes with one trait: `[Attr] Armour X/Y/Z`, where X, Y and Z are numbers.
- This trait may appear multiple times on the same armour.
`[Attr]` tells you what attributes the bonuses you get from your armour apply to. Multiple attributes are sometimes listed.
- `Phys` is shorthand for Physical - **Brawn** and **Finesse**, while `Ment` is shorthand for Mental - **Acumen**, **Logic** and **Vibe**.
	- **Mettle** is generally listed separately, as it can be affected in a physical or mental sense.
- `Core` applies to defending with any core attribute.
- `Archetype` means your archetype attribute.
		- A specific archetype attribute may be listed. This means that the bonus only applies to characters with that archetype attribute.
The three numbers are specific bonuses or penalties to Tier 1, 2 and 3 thresholds when defending with that attribute. These numbers can be negative.
- *Example:* `Brawn Armour 1/0/1` means Tier 1 and Tier 3 thresholds increase by 1 when defending with **Brawn**.
- *Example:* `Phys Mettle Armour 1/2/2` means Tier 1 thresholds increase by 1 and Tier 2 and 3 thresholds increase by 2 when defending with **Brawn,** **Finesse** and **Mettle**.
- *Example:* `Brawn Armour 2/2/2` `Finesse Armour -1/-1/-1` means all Tier thresholds increase by 2 when defending with **Brawn**, but all Tier thresholds decrease by 1 when defending with **Finesse**.
#### Shields
Shields are protective items that take up one of your hands to give you a defensive bonus.
Shields always come with one trait: `[Weight] [Attr] Shield X`, where `X` is a number.
`[Attr]` functions the same as with armour.
`[Weight]` tells you what kind of shield you’re using, and what Tier threshold `X` will modify.
- `Light` is a shield like a buckler which is designed for parrying blows - `X` increases your Tier 1 threshold.
	- Light shields take up 2 slots in a container.
	- `X` on light shields is generally a larger number than on other shields.
- `Medium` is a shield like a round shield which is designed for softening blows while maintaining mobility - `X` increases your  Tier 3 threshold.
	- Medium shields take up 4 slots in a container.
- `Heavy` is a shield like a tower shield which is designed for resisting as much damage as possible - `X` increases your Tier 2 and 3 thresholds.
	- Heavy shields take up 6 slots in a container.
	- Some heavy shields may have `X/Y` instead - `X` increases your Tier 2 threshold and `Y` increases your Tier 3 threshold.
	- When using a `Heavy` shield, you lose one of your total available Motion Points that you get at the start of your turn.
- *Example:* `Heavy Brawn Shield 1/2` means Tier 2 thresholds increase by 1 and Tier 3 thresholds increase by 2 when defending with **Brawn**.
### Containers
Containers are items capable of granting you more [[#Carrying|slots]] to hold items.
- Containers could be bags of holding, crates, barrels, backpacks or even quivers.
The slots granted by a container are tracked separately from your core inventory slots.
- These slots cannot be marked off when you take Injuries (see [[#Damage and Injury]]).
The first filled slot(s) in a container are the very top of the container - the more slots in you go, the deeper into the container the item is.
#### Backpacks
Backpacks are relatively unique containers, in that they do not take up any of your core inventory slots.
However, you can only wear one backpack. 
### Consumables
Items with the `Consumable` trait are items which can be expended and used up - like a potion or a scroll.
- Items that can be used a limited amount of times but then recharge, like a magical sword with a laser feature, are not consumables.
### Gear
Some items might not fit neatly into any of the other categories - for example, a ten-foot pole or a mirror.
These items have the `Gear` trait and will have further details as to how they function inside of their descriptions.
## Carrying
Items are carried in slots.
- *Clarity:* NPCs do not have item slots. They carry whatever necessary for them to be a fun part of the game.
Each character has `10 + Brawn + Mettle` inventory slots. 
- Your hands can hold some very big things, but generally are bad for storing items, so they are not tracked as inventory.
	- *Clarity:* Items are not in your inventory when in your hands.
These slots are an approximation of things you can generally carry on your person.
- They could be attached to a belt loop, stored in cargo pockets or even hanging around your neck. 
Anything which could fit into a hand is one slot. You can bundle tiny items together into one slot.
Items that take up two hands such as a greatsword take up two slots.
Very large objects such as barrels or bodies of stout creatures like dogs take up four slots.
A standard person’s body takes up six slots. 
- If they carry one or more slots of items, it increases the amount of slots they take up by that much.
## Survival
Essentially every living character can be hurt and bleed in some way or another.
And as the saying goes - if it bleeds, it can be killed.
### Vigor
Vigor is a representation of your mental and physical ability to avoid serious harm.
Every character has `8 + ((Mettle + 1, minimum 1) * Level)` max Vigor.
- Warrior add their Presence to their max Vigor. As this attribute increases, so does the bonus to Vigor.
Nicks, grazes and bruises are some of the kinds of damage dealt to your Vigor physically.
A headache, sore eyes or faintly ringing ears are some of the kinds of damage dealt to your Vigor mentally.
### Damage and Injury
When you take damage, reduce your Vigor by that amount. 
If you take damage and your Vigor has reached 0, mark off an inventory slot of your choice for each point of damage taken.
- These are Injuries. Fill them in thematically and role-play accordingly.
	- Injuries dealt via physical sources may look like a blistering burn, a gouge in the flesh or a fractured limb.
	- Injuries dealt via mental sources may look like a torrentially bleeding nose, shaking limbs or an endless stream of tears.
Body armour in your inventory is rendered ineffective if all of its slots are marked off.
You cannot put items into wounded slots, but you can take items out of them.
#### Direct Injury
Damage that deals a Direct Injury bypasses Vigor and injures your inventory slots directly. 
This happens when your fighting and evasive capacities would still not be enough to prevent injury.
- *Example:* Falling onto spikes is going to deal quite a few direct injuries. Falling in general does too!
 If an NPC is dealt any amount of Direct Injuries, triple that damage to account for their lack of item slots. 
#### Death
If all of your inventory slots are marked off and you no Vigor left, you die.
NPCs die at 0 Vigor.
#### Healing
Vigor resets to the maximum amount after four intervals of Rest (see [[#Resting]]).
When you take a [[#Taking a Respite|Respite]], you heal an amount of injuries equal to `1+Mettle`.
## Traits
Traits are short descriptors which can be applied to features, items or characters.
A trait can carry mechanical function in itself, and is often used for reference by other mechanics.
All traits have at least one sub-trait, and those sub-traits state what the trait can be applied to - a feature, an item, or a character.
## Features
A feature is an ability, talent or capability which your character possesses in some form.
- *Example:* a feature could be telepathy, a lightning bolt spell or even just exceptional public speaking ability.
All features start with at least one trait that determines what kind of feature it is for grouping and mechanical reference.
- A feature tagged `Magic` is a magical spell or power, like a fire bolt or a passive magical sense!
- A feature tagged `Active` is a feature that requires “activation” to use it - this could be Motion Points, an action or multiple actions!
- A feature tagged `Passive` is a feature that gives a constant benefit to the player - like a permanent increase in Vigor, or sight for the invisible! 
- A feature tagged `Item` is a feature that is granted by an item the character carries with them, for example a sword might grant the wielder a spell!
## Skills
Skills are your intrinsic characteristic capabilities that allow you to perform better than standard in Checks.
When you have a skill, you add your whole level to your check, instead of half your level - minimum of +1.
## Language
To determine what languages you know and how well you know them, take your Logic score and add two (minimum zero).
This is the amount of points you have to you spend on learning and improving in languages.
- During character creation, you must spend all of these points. 
	- If your Logic attribute improves, you gain points equal to the improvement, but you need not spend them until it seems appropriate to.
A language can have up to two points in it.
To learn a language, write it down, place one available point in it and choose whether you can speak that language or can read and write it.
If you place a second point into a language, you gain the other half of the capability - speaking or literacy.
If you have no points during character creation, still pick a language, however you are illiterate and can only speak it in broken forms.
## Improving
The more you adventure, put yourself at risk and discover the world, the more you improve as a character.
Mechanically, improvement is based on completing objectives and surviving combat encounters.
The resource used to track these achievements is known as Experience.
### Gaining Experience
#### Combat Encounters
You gain 1 Experience for each combat encounter you clear, through violence or not. 
- A small, easy or otherwise inconsequential combat encounter is a minor combat encounter.
- Minor encounters do not count for Experience by themselves. 
	- However, the Director should count approximately three as worth 1 Experience collectively.
- Persuasion against violence should count as a combat encounter.
- Completely missing a combat encounter does not grant any Experience.
	- Stealthing through a combat encounter counts as the size of that combat encounter.
	- Escape from danger counts as a minor combat encounter.
		- Dispatching a notable number of enemies during an escape improves this to a combat encounter. 
#### Roleplay and Exploration
Clearing the entirety of a notable location grants you 1 Experience.
If you obtain a key item or piece of knowledge, you gain 1 Experience.
Changing an important person’s perspective on something may grant you 1 Experience.
- After a while, you may need to make larger impacts than just one person to gain Experience.
As a good rule of thumb, most notable objectives a player or party has should grant Experience upon completion.
### Levelling Up
To reach your next level, you need to meet an Experience Threshold.
The Experience Threshold required to reach your next level is calculated as `5+(2*CurrentLevel)`.
When your current Experience equals or exceeds Experience Threshold, increase your level by 1 at the end of your next Respite.
When you increase your level, clear your tracked Experience.
- Any Experience that exceeded your previous Experience Threshold carries over. 
	- *Example:* if your Experience Threshold was 25 and you had 29 Experience, you have 4 Experience at the start of your next level. 
Every four levels (4, 8, 12…), you increase two core attributes of your choice by one.
Your archetype attribute increases by 1 every three levels (3, 6, 9…).
# Adventuring
## Rolling Dice
The entire game relies on this roll format - **2d6 + HL + Attribute**.
These are compared against DVs, or Difficulty Values.
DVs have Tiers, which have a threshold value. You must pass that threshold value to achieve that tier of result.
Take the result of the highest tier you pass.
Rolls should only be made when there is an element of **risk.** 
- If there are no risks, do not roll - you succeed in your goal after however long it takes.
	- *Director Advice:* The line for what constitutes risk is up to you and your setting. In heroic fantasy, a strong character kicking in a door likely would not need a check. But in a grim, dark, dungeon crawler? Roll for that, totally!
		- Fighting is generally always a risk.
### Checks
Checks are non-combat actions. If you are doing a thing which will hurt somebody, they will have a defence against it, and as such Defence DVs should be used.
#### Easy Check DVs
> If something is easy, you probably dont need to roll for it. However, edge case scenarios or more brutal settings may find use in this.
- Two 1s and/or below Tier 1:***Silver-Lined Failure!*** - You don’t manage to achieve your goal, however its not all bad.
- 3: Tier 1 - *Imperfect Success* - You manage to achieve what you’re going for, but something complicates the situation.
- 7: Tier 2 - *Success* - You succeed smoothly at your task!
- 10 or two 6s: Tier 3 - ***Critical Success!*** - you manage to succeed at your goal flawlessly, and gain an extra edge from it!
#### Normal Check DVs
- Two 1s and/or below Tier 1: ***Fumbled Attempt!*** - you fail to achieve what you set out to do.
- 3: Tier 1 - *Silver-Lined Failure* - You don’t manage to achieve your goal, however its not all bad.
- 7: Tier 2 - *Imperfect Success* - You manage to achieve what you’re going for, but something complicates the situation.
- 10: Tier 3 - *Success* - You succeed smoothly at your task!
- two 6’s: ***Critical Success!*** - you manage to succeed at your goal flawlessly, and gain an extra edge from it!
#### Hard Check DVs
- Two 1s and/or below Tier 1: ***Tragic Fumble!*** - you fail to achieve what you set out to do, and things are getting worse for you…
- 3: Tier 1 - *Fumbled Attempt* - You fail to achieve what you set out to do.
- 7: Tier 2 - *Silver-Lined Failure* - You don’t manage to achieve your goal, however its not all bad.
- 10: Tier 3 - *Imperfect Success* - You manage to achieve what you’re going for, but something complicates the situation.
- 12: Tier 4 - *Success* - You succeed smoothly at your task!
- two 6’s: ***Critical Success!*** - You manage to succeed at your goal flawlessly, and gain an extra edge from it!
### Attacking
Dealing damage, physically or mentally, means you’re Attacking.
When you Attack, your target will be defending with something - the strength of that defence determines the Defence DV. 
When you Attack, roll once, and then compare your roll result to the tiers of your target’s Defence DV.
You add a bonus of HL and the attribute you’re attacking with. 
The defender adds HL and the attribute that they’re defending with to each Tier.
- Your action will specify what attributes the defender is allowed to use in their defence.
#### Defence DVs
- Two 1s and/or below Tier 1: ***Fumbled Attack!*** - you miss your attack.
- 3: Tier 1 - *Glancing Blow* - Your hit barely connects, nicking the opponent. Deal 1+HL damage.
- 7: Tier 2 - *Standard Impact* - Your hit lands an average blow against the enemy. Deal 2+HL damage.
- 10: Tier 3 - *Powerful Strike* - Your hit connects strongly! Deal 3+HL damage.
- Two 6s: ***Critical Hit!*** - Your hit connects beautifully and deals its fullest potential! Deal 5+HL damage.
## Activities and Intervals
In both Traversal and Dungeoneering, you perform Activities.
Activities are actions that are performed extended period of time known as an interval.
Intervals change duration depending on whether you are in Traversal or Dungeoneering.
Activities will either have the `Traversal` or `Dungeoneering` tag.
## Traversal
Traversal is moving long distances across land, either exploring randomly or travelling directly to another location.
While you are traversing, intervals are 2 hours.
A day is made up of three blocks of four intervals, making each block 8 hours long.
- The first block is for travel. These four intervals are spent actually moving across the ground.
	- roll a d6 for a Random Encounter during the second interval of this block.
- The second block is for camping. These four intervals are spent setting up camp, checking out nearby points of interest, and eating.
	- roll a d6 for a Random Encounter during the second interval of this block.
- The third block is for rest. These four intervals are spent rotating watches, sleeping and healing.
	- roll a d20 for a Random Encounter during the every interval of this block.
## Dungeoneering
Dungeoneering is exploring a specific location with the expectation of fights, traps and loot.
- Dungeoneering could be raiding an enemy stronghold, exploring a forgotten crypt or checking your home in the night for intruders.
When you are dungeoneering, intervals are 10-minutes.
A day is made up of twenty-four blocks of six intervals, making each block 1 hour long.
Dungeoneering Activities are actions performed while dungeoneering that takes up one interval. 
- Moving through a location, searching, fighting a combat encounter or picking a lock are examples of Activities.
- [[#Pausing]] is an Activity that takes one interval, and must be done once every twelve Intervals (two hours). 
	- Failing to pause once every twelve intervals results in a -1 penalty to attack rolls until you pause.
At the start of every even interval in a block, roll a d6 for a Random Encounter.
## Random Encounters
Players may encounter random groups of NPCs on their adventures, be it a pack of dogs, a wandering trader or a bandit horde.
If you are told to roll a Random Encounter, roll the dice the instruction tells you to. On a 1, a Random Encounter happens.
### Reaction 
To find the NPC’s attitude towards the players, roll 2d6 on the reaction table or pick a reaction if you dislike the result.
- 2-3: Violent  
- 4-6: Defensive  
- 7-8: Indifferent  
- 9-10: Inquisitive  
- 11-12: Welcoming
## Fighting
When a combat encounter starts, you are fighting.
### Initiative
When a fight breaks out, roll a d6.
- 1-3, the opposing side of NPCs goes first.
- 4-6, the players and their companions (if any) go first.
Whichever side goes first, they choose amongst themselves who acts first. 
Once that person has acted, the opposing side goes next, and they choose someone to act.
This repeats until one side is out of people to act - the side with remaining people has the others all act in series at the end of Initiative.
### Zones and Space
Movement and reach are tracked in zones.
#### Zones
A zone is a fluidly shapable section of space.
Zones shape around terrain and can be added, changed and even removed if necessary.
- *Example:* A standard forest map will have zones around its ground terrain, but a player who climbs a tree may find themselves moving through a “trunk” zone and then into a “tree branches” zone.
There are two types of zone - ground and air.
##### Ground Zones
A ground zone is sectioned space on the ground, or sometimes above a pit.
A ground zone in wide open space generally has a perimeter no larger than 60 feet, and takes the form of a 15 foot by 15 foot square.
- *Clarity:* This can also be seen as an area no larger than 225 square feet.
- This is not a goal to meet - zones can be smaller than this amount if necessary.
	- If necessary, zones can also be larger than this.
		- However, the speed of movement is designed around these sizes, so proceed with caution.
As such, you can comfortably fit roughly nine normally-sized characters inside of the conventionally largest zone.
##### Air Zones
An air zone is space in the air in which creatures that can fly do so at a height outside the normal reach of characters on the ground.
An air zone is most often larger than a ground zone, and is formed by grouping lower zone boundaries into one large zone.
Generally, around four ground zones make up the space of one air zone
##### Marking Out Zones
Zones may seem complex at first, but once some rules of thumb are known, they can be quickly and easily established.
The walls of a room are a good place to start with the edges of your zones - walls are rarely within the actual space of a zone.
If a room is particularly long or wide, divide it one or more times horizontally or vertically until it reaches reasonable lengths.
If a zone has a large obstacle within it, such as a pillar, divide that zone into two halves to allow positional counterplay around the obstacle. 
When sectioning a pit, if it should not be jumpable by the average person, divide it into two or more zones along that length.
An air zone should generally be twice the size of your ground zones, so you can fit approximately four ground zones into one air zone.
### Actions and motions
#### Actions
Actions are the main thing you do on your turn, whether its swinging a sword, manifesting magic or singing a valorous war-cry.
You get one Action on your turn.
A series of standard actions are available to all, but many items and `Fight` features require an Action to perform. 
##### Standard Actions
- **Sprint:** You gain two temporary Motion Points that disappear at the end of your turn.
- **Attack:** You use a weapon in your hand(s) to make a strike against someone else - refer to your weapon’s unique effects and roll!
- **Administer:** You use an item on someone else, such as pouring a potion down their throat. Only doable within your arm’s reach.
#### Motion and Maneuver
Maneuvers are smaller actions which you can do on your turn.
- Doing things such as moving between zones, opening doors or clearing obstructions are examples of maneuvers.
Maneuvers are accomplished by spending Motion Points.
##### Motion Points
You have an amount of Motion Points equal to your speed + 1.
You can spend these points on your turn in order to perform maneuvers. 
You gain all your Motion Points back at the start of your turn.
There are some standard maneuvers everyone can perform.
##### Standard Maneuvers
Maneuvers are listed as `Maneuver Name (Motion Point Cost): Description`
- **Dive (0):** You fall to the ground, Prone.
	- While Prone, moving into a zone costs an extra Motion Point.
	- Attacks made with a reach of `1` or more against you take a -2 to the roll.
	- Attacks made with a reach of `0` or less against you take a +2 to the roll, and yours take a -2.
- **Stand (1):** You stand up from Prone.
- **Move (X):** You move from your current zone into a new zone.
	- You can spend as many motion points as you wish on one **Move**.
	- You can spend one Motion Point in a **Move** to get up from being Prone.
	- If you spend more Motion Points on **Move** than your Speed in one turn, then you’re running - take -2 to any Actions you take on this turn. 
	- Some zones may have [[#Moving Through Obstructions|Obstructions]] which can cause you to lose Motion Points when you move into them or start within them.
		- *Warning:* If you end your **Move** within a zone that has a zone obstruction
- **Open (1):** You open something, like a door or container.
	- If a door has something easily clearable, like a liftable barrier on your side, you can open that as part of the same maneuver.
	- If a door or container is locked or obstructed, you do not lose your Motion Point when you try and open it.
- **Clutch (1):** You grab an object in open space, like a knife on a table, a bottle in your pocket or a torch from a wall.
	- You can only **Clutch** objects within the reach of your character.
		- This includes your character’s inventory.
	- The object cannot be inside of a container unless it is on the very top of the container..
		- This includes any containers in your character’s inventory.
	- Your hand must be free to grab the object.
	- Letting go of an item requires no action. 
- **Rummage (2):** You dig through a container for a specific item to grab.
	- The container must be open.
	- The Director will give you the contents of what you find in the container.
	- You **Clutch** the item you’re looking for as part of the maneuver, as long as you have a free hand.
		- You can grab one item in each free hand.
- **Leap (2):** You leave the ground and jump through a zone, landing in another zone beyond it.
	- The Director can call for a Check to see if you stick the landing.
		- *Fumble:* Prone & 1+HL damage, *Tier 1:* Prone, *Tier 2:* Stable Landing, *Tier 3/Crit:* Regain 1 Motion Point!
		- This check is not always necessary - remember to only roll when there is risk!
	- If you **Move** one zone right before you **Leap**, you’ve taken a run-up and can jump through a second zone!
		- This kind of jump should almost always require a Check
- **Unblock (2):** You displace, modify or remove an object in your way, such as a lock or a pile of rubble.
	- Clearing obstructions will often require a Check, for which the Director will determine what is appropriate.
		- You may, of course, propose alternatives.
	- Failing to clear an obstruction still costs the Motion Points spent.
	- In the case of a lock, causing something to be unlocked will also open it at no cost to you.
- **Consume (2):** You use an item you have in your hand(s), like a potion or a scroll.
- **Surge (3):** You gain an extra action.
	- Surge can only be used once per turn.
#### Movement
Every character and NPC has a number pertaining to how fast they comfortably move around, labelled Speed.
- This number tends to be 2, but can be higher or lower.
To move, you spend a Motion Point to take the **Move** maneuver, leaving one zone and entering another one.
Moving within the same zone is done narratively, and does not cost any Motion Points.
##### Moving Through Obstructions
Sometimes while moving you may encounter objects in your way - these are obstructions.
Obstructions have three types - light, heavy and zone.
*Light* obstructions are obstacles such as doors that or shut or barred on your side.
- These can be cleared by using **Open**.
*Heavy* obstructions are obstacles such a locked door, or a doorway with a bookshelf in front of it. 
- These can be cleared with an **Unblock**.
*Zone* obstructions are obstacles such as tangled vines or a floor of ice, and take up a whole zone.
- If you enter a zone obstruction with a **Move** or start a **Move** within one, you lose a Motion Point.
- Zone obstructions have specific clearing conditions - some may let you **Unblock**, some may not! 
- Hostile characters and NPCs are zone obstructions.
#### Reach
`Reach` is an incredibly common tag that features, characters or items can have.
Everything you do depends on what is within reach of you or your equipment and abilities.
- You may want to shoot someone at the end of a corridor, grab a knife from a table nearby you or poke the floor in front of you.
Most things you want to do have a reach associated with them - `Self`, a number starting from `0`, or `Special`.
- `Reach Self` means your target can only be yourself.
- `Reach 0` means your target is within the zone you are in.
	- Most melee weapons have `reach 0`.
- `Reach 1` means your target can be in a zone adjacent to you.
	- Long weapons, like polearms and whips, or tossed items like a net, have a `reach 1`.
- `Reach 2` and greater means your target can be up to 2 or more zones away from you.
	- Most ranged weaponry has a `reach 2` or more.
- `Reach Special` is complex, and will be explained within the tagged component.
The reach of a character’s own body is 0 unless specified otherwise.
- This is often referred to as arm’s reach.
### Morale and Conclusion
Opposing NPCs might look the state of a fight and think it better to give up, rather than lose their life.
In these situations, the Director should roll for Morale for the entirety of that side.
#### When To Roll Morale
Morale should be rolled when:
- The enemy leader falls.  
- Half of the NPCs are eliminated.
- A lone enemy has a quarter of their Vigor left.
#### Rolling Morale
Roll for Morale by rolling 2d6 and compare it to the Morale score of each remaining NPC on that side.
If the Directors result is higher than an NPCs Morale score, that creature breaks.
- A Morale score of `—` means the NPC does not have survival instincts and therefore does not leave fights.
When an NPC breaks, roll a d6 to determine how they act.
- On a 1-3, the creature flees.
- On a 4-6, the creature surrenders.
#### Conclusion
Combat ends when one side is no longer an active threat to the other.
This could be because one side is dead, has surrendered, decided to flee, are pacified, or are just being negotiated with right now.
## Downtime
### Pausing
Pausing is a 10-minute activity in which everyone catches their breath, rests their feet, and checks over their equipment. 
This is also a good time to discuss the journey so far, ponder upcoming strategy and answer any lingering questions.
It’s also a good time for the players to go to the bathroom, refill water and stretch their bodies.
It is important to pause while [[#Dungeoneering]] to avoid a fatiguing penalty.
### Resting
Resting is when you sleep for the night and allow your body to recharge its core functions.
Resting is performed in an 8 hour block in four 2-hour intervals.
You must be asleep for at least three of these intervals to gain the benefits of a Rest.
- *Clarity:* These intervals do not need to be perfectly consecutive.
During a Rest in a non-safe location, players will require a watch. 
A watch is a Traversal Activity in which one conscious character stays awake and keeps an eye out for threats.
### Taking a Respite
Taking a Respite involves a full 24 hours of rest, recovery and gentle recreation.
A Respite can only be taken in a safe location, such as your established camp, a city, your home or a train.
At the end of a full Respite, you heal an amount of Injuries equal to `1+Mettle (minimum 1)` - remove the Injury marks from these slots.
